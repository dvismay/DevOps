1. Node Js is a container not a langauge or a framework. It uses Google's v8 javascript engine

2. Like Window object in browsers we have "global" object in node

3. Every module is a file

4. scope of variables defined in a file is limited to a file

5. Need to specify what can be made public by using an explicit "module.exports"

6. In file in which we want to export use tag "require(path of module)"

7. "GIT Commit"
